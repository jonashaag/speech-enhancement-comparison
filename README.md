Deep Xi has been updated to TensorFlow 2!
====

Deep Xi: *A Deep Learning Approach to *A Priori* SNR Estimation.*
====

Deep Xi is implemented in TensorFlow 2 and is used for speech enhancement, noise estimation, for mask estimation, and as a front-end for robust ASR.
----
[Deep Xi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2019.06.002) (where the Greek letter 'xi' or ξ is pronounced  /zaɪ/) is a deep learning approach to *a priori* SNR estimation that was proposed in [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2019.06.002) and is implemented in [TensorFlow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Some of its use cases include:


* It can be used by minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approaches to **speech enhancement** like the MMSE short-time spectral amplitude (MMSE-STSA) estimator.
* It can be used by minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approaches to **noise estimation**, as in *DeepMMSE* [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9066933).
* Estimate the ideal binary mask **(IBM)** for missing feature approaches or the ideal ratio mask **(IRM)**.
* A **front-end for robust ASR**, as shown in **Figure 1**.

| <p align="center"> <b>Figure 1:</b> Deep Xi used as a front-end for robust ASR. The back-end (Deep Speech) is available <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech">here</a>. The noisy speech magnitude spectrogram, as shown in <b>(a)</b>, is a mixture of clean speech with <i>voice babble</i> noise at an SNR level of -5 dB, and is the input to Deep Xi. Deep Xi estimates the <i>a priori</i> SNR, as shown in <b>(b)</b>. The <i>a priori</i> SNR estimate is used to compute an MMSE approach gain function, which is multiplied elementwise with the noisy speech magnitude spectrum to produce the clean speech magnitude spectrum estimate, as shown in <b>(c)</b>. <a href="https://github.com/anicolson/matlab_feat">MFCCs</a> are computed from the estimated clean speech magnitude spectrogram, producing the estimated clean speech cepstrogram, as shown in <b>(d)</b>. The back-end system, Deep Speech, computes the hypothesis transcript, from the estimated clean speech cepstrogram, as shown in <b>(e)</b>. </p> |


How does Deep Xi work?
----
A training example is shown in **Figure 2**. A deep neural network (DNN) within the Deep Xi framework is fed the **noisy-speech short-time magnitude spectrum** as input. The training target of the DNN is a mapped version of the instantaneous *a priori* SNR (i.e. **mapped *a priori* SNR**). The instantaneous *a priori* SNR is mapped to the interval `[0,1]` to improve the rate of convergence of the used stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The map is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the instantaneous *a priori* SNR, as given by Equation (13) in [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2019.06.002). The statistics for the CDF are computed over a sample of the training set. An example of the mean and standard deviation of the sample for each frequency bin is shown in **Figure 3**. The training examples in each mini-batch are padded to the longest sequence length in the mini-batch. The **sequence mask** is used by TensorFlow to ensure that the DNN is not trained on the padding. During inference, the *a priori* SNR estimate is computed from the mapped *a priori* SNR using the sample statistics and Equation (12) from [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9066933).

Which audio do I use with Deep Xi?
----
Deep Xi operates on mono/single-channel audio (not stereo/dual-channel audio). Single-channel audio is used due to most cell phones using a single microphone. The available trained models operate on a sampling frequency of `f_s=16000`Hz, which is currently the standard sampling frequency used in the speech enhancement community. The sampling frequency can be changed in `run.sh`. Deep Xi can be trained using a higher sampling frequency (e.g. `f_s=44100`Hz), but this is unnecessary as human speech rarely exceeds 8 kHz (the Nyquist frequency of `f_s=16000`Hz is 8 kHz). The available trained models operate on a window duration and shift of `T_d=32`ms and `T_s=16`ms, respectively. To train a model on a different window duration and shift, `T_d` and `T_s` can be changed in `run.sh`. Currently, Deep Xi supports `.wav`, `.mp3`, and `.flac` audio codecs. The audio codec and bit rate does not affect the performance of Deep Xi.

Naming convention in the `set/` directory
-----

**Training set**

The filenames of the waveforms in the `train_clean_speech` and `train_noise` directories are not restricted. There can be a different number of waveforms in each. The Deep Xi framework utilises each of the waveforms in `train_clean_speech` once during an epoch. For each mini-batch of `train_clean_speech`, the Deep Xi framework selects a random section of a randomely selected waveform from `train_noise` (that is at a length greater than or equal to the train clean speech waveform) and adds it to the train clean speech waveform at a randomly selected SNR level (the SNR level range can be set in `run.sh`). 

**Validation set**




**Test set**

The filenames of the waveforms in the `test_noisy_speech` directory are not restricted. This is all that is required if you want inference outputs from Deep Xi, i.e. `./run.sh VER="ANY_NAME" INFER=1`. If you are obtaining objective scores by using `./run.sh VER="ANY_NAME" TEST=1`, then reference waveforms for the objective measures need to be placed in `test_clean_speech`. The filename of the waveform in `test_clean_speech` that corresponds to a waveform in `test_noisy_speech` must must be contained in the corresponding test noisy speech waveforn filename. E.g. if the filename of a test noisy speech waveform is `test_noisy_speech/61-70968-0000_SIGNAL021_-5dB.wav`, then the filename of the corresponding test clean speech waveform must be contained in the filename of the test noisy speech waveform: `test_clean_speech/61-70968-0000.wav`. This is because a test clean speech waveform may be used as a reference for multiple waveforms in `test_noisy_speech` (e.g. `test_noisy_speech/61-70968-0000_SIGNAL021_0dB.wav`, `test_noisy_speech/61-70968-0000_SIGNAL021_5dB.wav`, and `test_noisy_speech/61-70968-0000_SIGNAL021_10dB.wav` are additional test noisy speech waveforms that the test clean speech waveform from the previous example is a reference for).

Current networks
-----
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), are available: <!-- and attention-based networks -->
<!--- * **MHANet**: Multi-head attention network. --->
* **ResNet**: Residual network.
* **ResLSTM**: Residual long short-term memory network.

<!--- Deep Xi utilising the MHANet (**Deep Xi-MHANet**) was proposed in . --->

Deep Xi utilising a ResNet TCN (**Deep Xi-ResNet**) was proposed in [[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9066933). It uses bottleneck residual blocks and a cyclic dilation rate. The network comprises of approximately 2 million parameters and has a contextual field of approximately 8 seconds. An example of Deep Xi-ResNet is shown in **Figure 4**. **A trained model for version `resnet-1.0c` is available in the [`model`](https://github.com/anicolson/DeepXi/tree/master/model) directory. It is trained using the [Deep Xi Training Set](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/deep-xi-training-set).**

Deep Xi utilising a ResLSTM network (**Deep Xi-ResLSTM**) was proposed in [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.specom.2019.06.002). Each of its residual blocks contain a single LSTM cell. The network comprises of approximately 10 million parameters.
